        <h1>The Air Pollution Crisis in New Delhi: A Call for Action</h1>
        <p>
            Air pollution has become a pressing issue in New Delhi, with the city's Air Quality Index (AQI) frequently
            reaching hazardous levels. The situation has become so severe that schools have had to shift to online
            classes to protect the health of students and staff. This article explores the causes and consequences of
            air pollution in New Delhi and the impact on education.
        </p>
        <h2>Causes of Air Pollution in New Delhi</h2>
        <p>
            The primary contributors to air pollution in New Delhi include vehicular emissions, industrial activities,
            construction dust, and crop burning in neighboring states. The city's geographical location also plays a role,
            as it is surrounded by the Himalayas, which trap pollutants and prevent them from dispersing.

        <h1>IMPACTS</h1>
        <h2>Health Impacts</h2>
        <p>
            The health impacts of air pollution are profound. Exposure to high levels of pollutants such as particulate
            matter (PM2.5 and PM10) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) can lead to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases,
            including asthma, bronchitis, and heart attacks. Vulnerable populations, such as children,
            the elderly, and those with pre-existing health conditions, are particularly at risk.
        </p>
        <h2>Impact on Education</h2>
        <p>
            The deteriorating air quality has forced schools in New Delhi to shift to online classes. This decision was
            made to protect students from the harmful effects of pollution, as prolonged exposure can lead to serious
            health issues. The shift to online learning has disrupted the traditional classroom experience and posed
            challenges for both students and teachers. However, it has also highlighted the need for sustainable
            solutions to address air pollution and ensure a safe learning environment.

        <h2>Government Initiatives</h2>
        <p>
            The government has implemented several measures to combat air pollution, including the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP), which imposes restrictions on activities such as construction, vehicular traffic, and industrial operations during high pollution periods. Additionally, the Supreme Court has ordered strict vigilance at entry points to monitor and restrict the entry of polluting vehicles.
        </p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            The air pollution crisis in New Delhi is a complex issue that requires a multi-faceted approach to address effectively. While online classes provide a temporary solution, long-term measures are needed to improve air quality and protect public health. It is crucial for the government, industries, and citizens to work together to create a cleaner and healthier environment for future generations.
